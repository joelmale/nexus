# Contributing to Nexus VTT

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Nexus VTT! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Docker Desktop (must be installed and running)

### Setup
1.  **Fork and Clone**
    Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the project root and add the database connection string:
    ```
    DATABASE_URL="postgres://nexus:password@localhost:5432/nexus"
    ```

4.  **Start Development Database**
    In a separate terminal, run the following command to start the PostgreSQL container:
    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d postgres-dev
    ```

5.  **Run the Application**
    Once the database is running, use this command to start the frontend and backend servers:
    ```bash
    npm run start:all
    ```

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Frontend React application
- `server/` - Backend WebSocket server
- `src/components/` - React components
- `src/stores/` - Zustand state management
- `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `src/utils/` - Utility functions and services

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code formatting
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic

### Component Guidelines
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Follow the glassmorphism design system

### State Management
- Use Zustand for global state
- Keep state updates immutable (use Immer)
- Organize state by feature domains

### Git Workflow
1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. Make your changes with clear, descriptive commits
3. Test your changes thoroughly
4. Push to your fork and create a pull request

## Commit Messages

This project uses a simplified version of the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. The format is enforced by a pre-commit hook.

The format is:
`<type>: <A short summary of the change>`

Where `<type>` must be one of the following:
*   `feat`: A new feature
*   `fix`: A bug fix
*   `improvement`: An improvement to an existing feature
*   `docs`: Documentation only changes
*   `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
*   `test`: Adding or fixing tests
*   `ci`: Changes to our CI configuration and scripts
*   `chore`: Routine tasks or maintenance

**Example:**
```
feat: Add user login via OAuth

- Add passport.js for authentication.
- Create new /auth/google and /auth/discord routes.
- Update welcome page with login buttons.
```
