### 2025-09-25 - UI Polish and Feature Integration

- ✅ **New: Branding Components**: Added `Assets.tsx` for consistent `NexusLogo` and `NexusIcon` branding.

- ✅ **Lobby Overhaul**: Significantly improved the lobby experience with a more robust UI for hosting and joining games, and better display of session information.
- ✅ **Layout Enhancements**: 
    - Made the context panel draggable and floatable.
    - The main `GameLayout` now dynamically switches between the `Lobby` and the main game view.
- ✅ **Component Refinements**:
    - `ContextPanel` now acts as a dynamic container for various panels like `DiceRoller`, `Settings`, and `Lobby`.
    - Added `Placeholder.tsx` for gracefully handling features that are still under development.
