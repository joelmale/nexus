## Latest Updates (Update this when making changes)

### 2025-10-08 - 3D Dice Box Integration (In Progress)
- **Feature**: Integrated @3d-dice/dice-box library (v1.1.4) for 3D animated dice rolls
  - âœ… **Positioning Fix**: Moved DiceBox3D component from DiceRoller to LinearGameLayout
    - Previously positioned with `position: fixed` relative to viewport (overlapped panel)
    - **Successful approach**: Positioned within `.scene-content` container using `position: absolute`
    - Container placed at `top: 10px, right: 10px` relative to scene area
    - Size: 500x400px with `zIndex: 1000` to stay above scene canvas
  - âœ… **Client-side Roll Generation**: Simplified architecture by moving roll logic to frontend
    - Uses `createDiceRoll()` from `utils/dice.ts` for local generation
    - Broadcasts to other players via WebSocket if connected, but works offline
    - Event type: `'dice/roll-result'` with full roll data
  - âœ… **WebSocket Port Fallback**: Smart port detection for development
    - Tries ports 5000, 5001, 5002, 5003 automatically (macOS ControlCenter blocks 5000)
    - Caches working port in localStorage for faster reconnection
    - Auto-reconnection in LinearGameLayout when loading with saved room code
  - âœ… **API Fix (v1.1.x)**: Corrected DiceBox initialization to match latest documentation
    - Was using old v1.0.x API: `new DiceBox('#dice-box', config)`
    - Fixed to v1.1.x API: `new DiceBox({ container: '#dice-box', ...config })`
    - Single config object argument with `container` property
    - Updated TypeScript definitions for v1.1.x callbacks and options
  - âœ… **3D Dice Rendering Successfully Working!**
    - **Root Cause**: Multiple z-index and CSS stacking issues
    - **Key Fixes that made it work**:
      1. **High z-index (10000)**: Positioned dice canvas above all other UI elements
      2. **CSS Overrides**: Created `dice-box-3d.css` with `!important` rules to force canvas display
      3. **Proper Container Positioning**: `position: absolute` within `scene-content` (which has `position: relative`)
      4. **Canvas Interaction**: `pointerEvents: 'auto'` to allow BabylonJS to interact with canvas
      5. **Correct v1.1.x Config**: Single config object with all required properties
    - **Verified Working**: BabylonJS v5.57.1 successfully initializes, canvas renders, dice roll and animate
    - **Console Confirms**: Canvas found (496x396), proper visibility, opacity: 1, display: block
  - âœ… **UI Refinements**: Reduced dice roller controls to 50% vertical height for better space usage
- **Key Files Touched**:
  - `src/components/DiceBox3D.tsx` - Main 3D dice component with v1.1.x API
  - `src/components/LinearGameLayout.tsx` - Added DiceBox3D to scene-content container
  - `src/components/DiceRoller.tsx` - Client-side roll generation, removed DiceBox3D, reduced control heights
  - `src/styles/dice-box-3d.css` - **NEW**: Critical CSS overrides for canvas visibility
  - `src/styles/dice-roller.css` - Reduced control heights by 50%
  - `src/styles/main.css` - Added dice-box-3d.css import
  - `src/types/dice-box.d.ts` - TypeScript definitions for v1.1.x API
  - `src/stores/gameStore.ts` - Added 'dice/roll-result' event handler
  - `src/utils/websocket.ts` - Port fallback and reconnection logic
- **Architectural Decisions**:
  - **3D Engine**: BabylonJS v5.57.1 with physics simulation (not Cannon.js as originally thought)
  - **API Design**: v1.1.x single config object with `container` selector property
  - **Positioning Strategy**: Absolute positioning within `scene-content` (relative container)
  - **Z-index Management**: High z-index (10000) to float above all game UI elements
  - **Canvas Control**: CSS `!important` overrides to ensure BabylonJS canvas always displays correctly
  - **Roll Generation**: Client-side using `createDiceRoll()`, with optional WebSocket sync
  - **Event Handling**: `pointerEvents: 'auto'` to allow BabylonJS canvas interaction
- **Implementation Success**:
  - âœ… 3D dice successfully render and animate in top-right of scene
  - âœ… Physics simulation working (dice tumble, settle, report correct values)
  - âœ… Audio feedback on roll completion
  - âœ… Theme switching functional (tested with Rock theme)
  - âœ… Roll history displays correctly
  - âœ… Offline mode works (no WebSocket required for rolling)
