# Session Persistence Architecture

*Created: September 26, 2025 | Updated: September 27, 2025*

## üéØ Problem Solved

Previously, game rooms were destroyed immediately when the host disconnected or when users refreshed their browser. This created a poor user experience where entire game sessions would be lost due to minor connection issues or accidental page refreshes.

**Status: ‚úÖ FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND WORKING**

## üèóÔ∏è Solution Architecture

### Multi-Layer Persistence Strategy

#### 1. **Client-Side Persistence** (`sessionPersistenceService`)
- **localStorage + Cookie Fallback**: Dual storage strategy for maximum reliability
  - Primary: localStorage storage with 24-hour session timeout
  - Fallback: HTTP cookies with 1-hour backup for localStorage failures
- **Automatic State Saving**: Saves state every 30 seconds and on important changes
- **Session Recovery**: Detects page refreshes and attempts to restore previous session
- **Smart Expiration**: 24-hour session timeout with 1-hour reconnection window

#### 2. **Server-Side Session Hibernation**
- **Room Hibernation**: Rooms enter "hibernating" state when host disconnects
- **10-Minute Grace Period**: Hibernated rooms remain recoverable for 10 minutes
- **Game State Preservation**: Complete game state (scenes, characters, initiative) preserved during hibernation
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Rooms are abandoned after hibernation timeout
- **State Synchronization**: Server receives and stores real-time game state updates

#### 3. **Bidirectional State Synchronization** ‚≠ê NEW
- **Real-Time Game State Sync**: Client automatically sends game state updates to server
- **Server-Side Game State Storage**: Server maintains complete game state for reconnection
- **Intelligent State Merging**: Server state takes precedence during reconnection for consistency
- **Host vs Player Recognition**: Proper role restoration with `?reconnect=` vs `?join=` URL parameters

## ‚úÖ Complete Implementation Details

### Session Recovery Flow (Working)
1. **Page Load**: `useSessionPersistence` hook checks for stored session data
2. **Data Discovery**: Attempts localStorage first, falls back to cookies if needed
3. **Session Validation**: Checks session age and validity (1-hour reconnection window)
4. **WebSocket Reconnection**: Connects with proper parameters (`?reconnect=ROOM` for hosts)
5. **Server Recognition**: Server recognizes host reconnection and restores room from hibernation
6. **State Synchronization**: Server sends complete game state back to client
7. **UI Restoration**: Client applies server state and restores complete game interface

### Game State Synchronization (Working)
1. **Auto-Save**: Client saves game state locally every 30 seconds and on changes
2. **Server Sync**: Host automatically sends game state updates to server
3. **Real-Time Updates**: Server receives `game-state-update` messages and stores state
4. **Reconnection**: Server includes complete `gameState` in `session/reconnected` events
5. **State Merge**: Client applies server state (authoritative) during reconnection

### Error Handling (Working)
- **Room Not Found**: Gracefully clears invalid sessions and creates new rooms
- **Session Expired**: Automatic cleanup with user-friendly notifications
- **Connection Failures**: Robust reconnection with exponential backoff
- **State Conflicts**: Server state takes precedence for consistency

## üìÅ Implementation Files

### Core Service Files
- `src/services/sessionPersistence.ts` - Client-side persistence service
- `src/hooks/useSessionPersistence.ts` - React hook for automatic state management
- `server/index.ts` - Enhanced with hibernation and recovery features
- `server/types.ts` - Extended room types with persistence metadata

### Integration Files
- `src/components/Layout.tsx` - Automatic persistence hook integration
- `src/stores/gameStore.ts` - Session persistence methods added

## üîÑ How It Works

### Normal Session Flow
1. **Host Creates Room**: Room created with active status
2. **Players Join**: Room activity tracked continuously
3. **Game State Updates**: Scenes, characters, settings auto-saved to localStorage
4. **Server State Sync**: Important game events update server-side room state

### Recovery Flow - Host Disconnect
1. **Host Disconnects**: Room enters "hibernating" status
2. **10-Minute Timer**: Hibernation timer started, players notified
3. **Host Reconnects**: Room reactivated, hibernation timer cleared
4. **State Restoration**: Game state merged from client and server

### Recovery Flow - Page Refresh
1. **Page Loads**: `useSessionPersistence` hook checks for stored session
2. **Session Found**: localStorage data validated and restored
3. **Auto-Reconnect**: WebSocket reconnection attempted with stored room code
4. **State Merge**: Local state merged with server state

### Recovery Flow - Network Issues
1. **Connection Lost**: Client detects WebSocket disconnection
2. **Automatic Retry**: Built-in reconnection attempts with exponential backoff
3. **Session Recovery**: Stored session data used to rejoin correct room
4. **State Synchronization**: Game state synchronized after reconnection

## üíæ Data Persistence Layers

### Client-Side (localStorage)
```typescript
interface PersistedSession {
  roomCode: string;
  userId: string;
  userType: 'host' | 'player';
  userName: string;
  hostId?: string;
  lastActivity: number;
  sessionVersion: number;
}

interface PersistedGameState {
  characters: Character[];
  initiative: InitiativeState;
  scenes: Scene[];
  activeSceneId: string | null;
  settings: UserSettings;
  lastUpdated: number;
  stateVersion: number;
}
```

### Server-Side (Memory + Hibernation)
```typescript
interface Room {
  code: string;
  host: string;
  players: Set<string>;
  connections: Map<string, WebSocket>;
  created: number;
  lastActivity: number;
  status: 'active' | 'hibernating' | 'abandoned';
  hibernationTimer?: NodeJS.Timeout;
  gameState?: {
    scenes: Scene[];
    activeSceneId: string | null;
    characters: Character[];
    initiative: InitiativeState;
  };
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Client-Side Settings
- **Auto-Save Interval**: 30 seconds (configurable)
- **Session Timeout**: 24 hours
- **Reconnection Window**: 1 hour
- **State Version**: Automatic compatibility checking

### Server-Side Settings
- **Hibernation Timeout**: 10 minutes
- **Abandonment Timeout**: 1 hour
- **Activity Tracking**: Continuous during active sessions

- ‚ùå No state recovery mechanisms

### After Implementation
- ‚úÖ Host disconnect = 10-minute recovery window
- ‚úÖ Page refresh = automatic session restoration
- ‚úÖ Network issues = seamless reconnection
- ‚úÖ Game state preserved across interruptions
- ‚úÖ Smart conflict resolution
- ‚úÖ Player notifications during hibernation

## üîß Development Features

// Session persistence debugging
const { logSessionData, simulateReconnection } = useSessionPersistenceDebug();

// Manual session control
const { saveNow, loadState, clearAll } = useSessionPersistence();

// Recovery UI helpers
const { hasRecoverableSession, showRecoveryPrompt } = useSessionRecoveryUI();
```
