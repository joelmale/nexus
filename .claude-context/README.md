# Claude Context Files

This directory contains context files to help Claude AI quickly understand the Nexus project structure and current state.

## How to Use

When starting a new conversation with Claude, reference these files:

```
"Read the files in .claude-context/ to understand my Nexus project, then help me with [your specific task]"
```

## File Descriptions

- **PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md** - High-level project description, features, and current status
