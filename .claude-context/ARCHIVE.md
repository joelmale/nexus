## Completed Project Plans

### Browser-Style Scene Tabs Implementation (September 2025)
**Status**: 83% Complete - Core functionality implemented, minor enhancements pending

The scene tab system was successfully redesigned to function like modern web browser tabs with the following completed features:

- ✅ Browser-style visual appearance with rounded corners
- ✅ Fixed positioning at top of main canvas area
- ✅ Horizontal scroll with arrow navigation for tab overflow
- ✅ Double-click inline renaming (DM only)
- ✅ Drag & drop tab reordering (DM only)
- ✅ Permission-based visibility (DM vs Player restrictions)
- ✅ Active tab highlighting and visual connection to content
- ✅ Smooth animations and transitions

**Remaining enhancements** (low priority):
- Context menu for right-click operations
- Scene duplication functionality
- Advanced mobile responsiveness

**Key Files Modified**:
- `src/components/Scene/SceneTabs.tsx` - Core tab component
- `src/styles/scenes.css` - Complete visual redesign
- WebSocket integration using existing scene events

## Small Documentation Files (Consolidated)

### Project Overview
**Vision**: Nexus VTT is a modern, web-based Virtual Tabletop (VTT) designed specifically for D&D 5e gameplay. Built with React, TypeScript, and real-time WebSocket communication.

**Core Features**:
- Real-time multiplayer gameplay with WebSocket communication
- Comprehensive D&D 5e character sheet system
- Advanced scene management with browser-style tabs
- Initiative tracking with full combat management
- Glassmorphism UI design with modern CSS architecture
- Session persistence and automatic recovery

### Key Technical Abstractions

**State Management**: Zustand stores for each major feature domain
- `gameStore` - Core game state and WebSocket management
- `characterStore` - D&D 5e character data and operations
- `initiativeStore` - Combat tracking and turn management

**Component Architecture**: Feature-based organization
- `Scene/` - Map canvas, tabs, and scene management
- `Characters/` - Character sheets and creation wizards
- Layout components with dynamic panel system

**CSS Architecture**: Modern design token system
- Design tokens in `design-tokens.css` for unified theming
- Atomic utilities in `utilities.css` for rapid development
- Component-specific styles with glassmorphism design

### Technology Stack Summary

**Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- React with functional components and hooks
- TypeScript for type safety and better DX
- Vite for fast development and optimized builds

**State Management**: Zustand + React Query
- Zustand for client-side state management
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates

**Styling**: Modern CSS with design tokens
- CSS Custom Properties for theming
- Glassmorphism design system
- Atomic utility classes for rapid development

**Backend**: Node.js + Express + Socket.io
- RESTful API for game management
- WebSocket for real-time communication
- Session persistence with localStorage + server hibernation

### Common Development Tasks

**Adding New Components**:
1. Create component in appropriate feature directory
2. Use design tokens from `design-tokens.css`
3. Add Zustand store if state management needed
4. Write unit tests in `tests/unit/`

**CSS Development**:
1. Use existing utility classes first
2. Extend design tokens for new values
3. Follow BEM methodology for component styles
4. Test across glassmorphism and solid themes

**State Management**:
1. Create Zustand slice for new feature domain
2. Use TypeScript interfaces for type safety
3. Integrate with WebSocket for real-time updates
4. Add persistence hooks if needed
