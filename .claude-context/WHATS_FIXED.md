# What Was Fixed - Session 2025-01-09

## Issues Found

### 1. ✅ Server Discovery Working
**Status:** Already working, user just didn't see the logs

The discovery messages WERE in the console:
```
websocket.ts:36 🔍 Discovering server via HTTP health checks...
websocket.ts:47 ✅ Found server on port 5001
websocket.ts:79 🎯 Using discovered port: 5001
websocket.ts:114 ✅ Connected to WebSocket on port 5001
```

### 2. ✅ Fixed: dev_quickDM "Room not found" Error
**Problem:** `dev_quickDM()` was creating fake room codes without actually connecting to WebSocket

**Before:**
```typescript
dev_quickDM() {
  const roomCode = Math.random()...  // ❌ Fake room code
  set({ roomCode, isConnectedToRoom: true })  // ❌ Lies about connection
  // No WebSocket connection!
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
dev_quickDM() {
  await createGameRoom(config)  // ✅ Real WebSocket room
  // Creates actual room on server
  // Gets real room code from server
  // Properly sets isConnectedToRoom
}
```

**Result:** Now "Skip to Game (DM)" creates a real room that survives page refreshes

### 3. ✅ Fixed: clearGameData() Crash
**Problem:** Trying to delete entities while querying them caused undefined references

**Solution:** Get all entities first, then delete (see previous session)

### On Page Refresh (with existing session)
```

✅ Auto-reconnection successful
```

## How Server Discovery Works

### Discovery Process
1. Frontend sends HTTP GET to `http://localhost:5000/health`
2. If fails, tries 5001, 5002, 5003
3. First successful response contains server port
4. Caches port in localStorage for faster next time
5. Next connection: Discovery runs again (in case server moved)

### Server Response
```json
GET http://localhost:5001/health

{
  "status": "ok",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "port": 5001,           // ✅ Server tells us its port
  "wsUrl": "ws://localhost:5001",
  "rooms": 1,
  "connections": 1
}
```

### Why CORS Error on 5000 is OK
```
GET http://localhost:5000/health net::ERR_FAILED 403 (Forbidden)
```

This is **expected behavior** when nothing is running on port 5000. The browser blocks the request and discovery moves to the next port.

## Testing

### Test 1: Server on Port 5001
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start server on 5001
PORT=5001 npm run server:dev

# Terminal 2: Start frontend
npm run dev

# Browser console should show:
# ✅ Found server on port 5001
```

### Test 2: Server Port Changes
```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
# Start on different port
PORT=5002 npm run server:dev

# Refresh browser
# Browser console should show:
# ✅ Found server on port 5002  (discovered new port!)
```

### Test 3: Clear Cache
```javascript
// Browser console
window.webSocketService.clearCachedPort()
// ✅ Cleared cached WebSocket port

// Refresh - will discover again
```

### Test 4: Skip to Game (DM)
```
1. Click "Mock Data" toggle ON
2. Click "Skip to Game (DM)"
3. Should see scenes load without errors
4. Refresh page - should stay connected
```
