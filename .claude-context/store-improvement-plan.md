# Store Architecture Improvement Plan

**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: Phase 2 Complete - Ready for Phase 3

---

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation of store architecture improvements for the Nexus VTT application. The goal is to reduce code duplication, improve maintainability, and add missing persistence features.

---

## Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 hours)

### ✅ Task 1.1: Remove Dead Code - hybridGameStore.ts
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Action**: Delete `src/stores/hybridGameStore.ts` (659 lines)
- **Reason**: Completely unused, was an experimental approach that was abandoned
- **Impact**: Reduces codebase by 659 lines, eliminates confusion
- **Risk**: None - no imports found

### ✅ Task 1.2: Fix Duplicate Responsibilities (Option B - Merge Stores)
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED (2025-10-10)
- **Action**: Merged `appFlowStore` into `gameStore`
- **Reason**: Eliminated duplicate responsibilities and manual synchronization
- **Changes Completed**:
  1. Updated GameState interface in `src/types/game.ts` with AppView, PlayerCharacter, GameConfig types
  2. Merged all appFlowStore actions into `src/stores/gameStore.ts`:
     - Navigation: `setView()`, `resetToWelcome()`
     - Room management: `joinRoomWithCode()`, `createGameRoom()`, `leaveRoom()`
     - Character management: `createCharacter()`, `selectCharacter()`, `saveCharacter()`, `getSavedCharacters()`, `deleteCharacter()`, `exportCharacters()`, `importCharacters()`
     - Session persistence: `saveSessionToStorage()`, `loadSessionFromStorage()`, `clearSessionFromStorage()`
     - Dev helpers: `dev_quickDM()`, `dev_quickPlayer()`
     - Helper utilities: `getBrowserId()`
     - Selector hooks: `useView()`, `useGameConfig()`, `useSelectedCharacter()`
  3. Updated 10 components to use `useGameStore` instead of `useAppFlowStore`:
     - LinearWelcomePage.tsx, PlayerSetupPage.tsx, DMSetupPage.tsx
     - LinearGameLayout.tsx, LobbyPanel.tsx, LinearLayout.tsx
     - Settings.tsx, PlayerPanel.tsx, DiceRoller.tsx, Layout.tsx
  4. Deleted obsolete files:
     - `src/stores/appFlowStore.ts` (508 lines)
     - `src/types/appFlow.ts`
     - `tests/unit/stores/appFlowStore.test.ts`
  5. Fixed test compatibility issues:
     - Updated `tests/unit/stores/gameStore-lifecycle.test.ts` to use non-hook helpers
     - Updated `tests/unit/components/PlayerPanel.test.tsx` to mock `useGameStore`
  6. Verified all 246 unit tests pass
- **Impact**:
  - Eliminated 508 lines of duplicate store code
  - No more manual sync between stores
  - Single source of truth for all application state
  - Clearer data flow and reduced complexity
- **Files Deleted**: 3 (appFlowStore.ts, appFlow.ts, appFlowStore.test.ts)
- **Files Modified**: 15 (1 type file, 1 store file, 10 components, 2 tests)

### ✅ Task 1.3: Add Persistence to characterStore
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Action**: Add Zustand persist middleware
- **Impact**: Characters survive page refresh

### ✅ Task 1.4: Add Persistence to initiativeStore
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Action**: Add Zustand persist middleware
- **Impact**: Combat state survives page refresh

---

## Phase 2: Consolidation (3-4 hours)

### ✅ Task 2.1: Remove gameLifecycleStore
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Action**: Migrated lifecycle actions to gameStore and updated all components
- **Reason**: Phases overlap with view state, creates unnecessary complexity
- **Impact**: -377 lines, simpler state management
- **Changes**:
  - Added lifecycle actions to gameStore: startPreparation, markReadyToStart, startGoingLive, goLive, pauseGame, resumeGame, endGame, joinLiveGame, leaveGame
  - Added derived selectors: useGamePhase, useGameMode, useLifecyclePermissions, useIsOnline, useCanGoLive, useServerRoomCode
  - Updated components: OfflinePreparation.tsx, Lobby.tsx, WelcomePage.tsx
  - All components now use gameStore instead of gameLifecycleStore

### ⏸️ Task 2.2: Add JSDoc Comments to Stores
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Action**: Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to all stores
- **Impact**: Better developer onboarding and maintenance

---

## Phase 3: Refactoring (8-12 hours) - OPTIONAL

### ⏸️ Task 3.1: Split gameStore into Domain Stores
- **Status**: DEFERRED (Optional)
- **Action**: Split into `sceneStore`, `tokenStore`, `settingsStore`, `sessionStore`, `persistenceStore`
- **Reason**: gameStore is large (1,470 lines), splitting would improve organization
- **Impact**: Better separation of concerns, easier testing
- **Risk**: High effort, requires coordinated migration

### ⏸️ Task 3.2: Add WebSocket Sync for Initiative
- **Status**: DEFERRED (Optional)
- **Action**: Add WebSocket event handlers to initiativeStore
- **Impact**: Real-time initiative tracking for multiplayer sessions

---

## Phase 4: Documentation (2 hours)

### ⏸️ Task 4.1: Write Store Architecture Documentation
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Action**: Create `docs/architecture/stores.md`
- **Content**: Store responsibilities, data flow diagrams, usage guidelines

### ⏸️ Task 4.2: Create Data Flow Diagrams
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Action**: Visual diagrams showing store relationships and data flow

---

## Testing Strategy

- View navigation tests (setView, navigation flow)
- Character management tests (createCharacter, saveCharacter, deleteCharacter)
- Session persistence tests (localStorage recovery)
- Dev helper tests (dev_quickDM, dev_quickPlayer, dev_skipToGame)

### Post-Merge Validation
- ✅ All baseline tests pass
- ✅ Component imports updated
- ✅ WebSocket integration verified
- ✅ Session persistence verified

## Migration Guide for Components

### Before (Using appFlowStore):
```typescript
import { useAppFlowStore } from '@/stores/appFlowStore';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { user, setUser, view, setView, roomCode } = useAppFlowStore();
  // ...
};
```

### After (Using merged gameStore):
```typescript
import { useGameStore } from '@/stores/gameStore';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { user, setUser, view, setView, roomCode } = useGameStore();
  // ...
};
```

**Files Updated**:
- ✅ src/components/LinearWelcomePage.tsx
- ✅ src/components/LinearGameLayout.tsx
- ✅ src/components/LobbyPanel.tsx
- ✅ src/components/PlayerSetupPage.tsx
- ✅ src/components/DMSetupPage.tsx
- ✅ All other components using appFlowStore

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Complete Phase 1 (Quick Wins)
2. ✅ Complete Phase 2 (Remove gameLifecycleStore)
3. Review and test merged store functionality
4. Decide on Phase 3 (Further refactoring) - Optional
5. Complete Phase 4 (Documentation)
6. **Ready**: Can now safely delete gameLifecycleStore.ts and gameLifecycleStore.test.ts

---

## Notes

- Option B (merge stores) was chosen over Option A (clear ownership) for simplicity
- Single large store is acceptable given the complexity reduction from eliminating sync
- If gameStore becomes too large in future, can revisit Phase 3 (domain split)
- All changes should be backward compatible with existing localStorage/IndexedDB data
