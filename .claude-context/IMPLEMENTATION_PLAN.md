## 📝 Decision Log

- **2025-09-26**: Chose Zustand over Redux for state management due to its simplicity and minimal boilerplate, aligning with our goal of rapid development.
- **2025-09-27**: Decided against a ResizeObserver for the ContextPanel due to performance issues and opted for a fixed-width system per panel type.
