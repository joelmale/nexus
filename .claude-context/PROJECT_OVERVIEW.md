- Drag-and-drop asset management with a powerful asset browser
- Sound effects system for atmospheric immersion
- Glassmorphism UI design with floating, draggable, and resizable panels
- Dynamically-sized side panel that adjusts to its content
- Comprehensive settings panel for user customization

## User Personas

- **The DM, 'Alex'**: Needs tools that are fast, intuitive, and automate as much of the tedious bookkeeping as possible so they can focus on storytelling.
